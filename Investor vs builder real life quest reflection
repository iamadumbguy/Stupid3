in my opinion,i think that fair for who working for salary,while they are hardwork for money,the investor just sit until money on the pocket.
+the risk the builder have to face its: industrial accident,job disease,pressure of job,injury,...      +and vice versa,the risk the investor can face is: discredit,unstable stalk,outdated product and more...
the best time for young people to start being both builder and investor is "now" (or it wont be happen untill u bettwen 20 -40)
